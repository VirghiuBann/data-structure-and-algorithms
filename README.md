**Algorithms and Data Structures Practice**

**This repository showcases my journey of practicing algorithms and data structures. It includes solutions to various coding challenges, organized into relevant categories.**

**Contents**

- **Algorithms:**

  - Recursive function.
  - Sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, counting sort, radix sort, bucket sort and shell sort.)
  - Searching algorithms (linear search, recursive linear search, transposition, move to from head and binary search.)

- **Coding Interview:**

  - Solutions to common coding interview questions (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.)
  - Practice for technical assessments.

- **Data Structures:**

  - Implementations of various data structures (linked lists, trees and graphs.)

**Goals**

- **Solidify my understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures.**
- **Prepare for technical interviews and coding challenges.**
- **Build a portfolio of code examples to demonstrate my problem-solving skills.**

**Future Work**

- Plan to add more solutions and explore advanced topics.
